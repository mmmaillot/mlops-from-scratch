# mlops-from-scratch
It's all in the name !

The purpose of this repository is to show, with a very basic example, how one can build iteratively, an MLOps infrastructure.

1. [Build and serve a model](./01_serving_a_model/Train_and_serve_a_basic_model_for_the_iris_dataset.md)
2. [Track your models](./02_tracking_a_model/Tracking_your_model.md)
